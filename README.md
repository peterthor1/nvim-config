# Neovim Configuration
My personal neovim configuration for development with Rust, SQL, Typescript, and Vue

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- The SQL language server can be configured at ~/sqls/config.yml

# Installation

```
# Uninstall previous config
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim

# Install new config
git clone https://github.com/peterthor1/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```
